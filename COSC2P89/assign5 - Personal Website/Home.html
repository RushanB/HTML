		<p>The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. 
		With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, 
		they became widely regarded as the greatest and most influential act of the 
		rock era.<br><br>
		Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles 
		later experimented with several genres, ranging from pop ballads and Indian 
		music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements 
		in innovative ways.<br><br>
		In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged 
		as "Beatlemania", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary 
		songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment 
		of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.</p>
