
-support retreiving album, song, and composer info
	-an album table:
		-row for each beatles album
		-each will have a unique key, album tilte, year it was realeased
		-bonus: include album cover image in image file or table directly
	-a song table:
		-unique primary key
		-song title
		-song lyrics(if not instrumental)
	-a composer table:
		-unique primary key
		-name of composer
		-birthdate
		-date of death(if not alive)
	-album songs table: to relate songs and albums
		-rows consisting of album id
		-song id that implies the corresponding song on corresponding album
			(note: song may appear on multiple albums or no album at all)
	-composer songs table: to relate composers and songs
		-rows consisting of composer id and
		-song id that implies the composer(perhaps not alone) composed the song

-recommended: 
	-start by creating the tables and provide some data for testing purposes
	-data can be entered bt using the phpmyadmin for mySQL.
	-after testing takes place then populate the tables with more data

-use AJAX to neatly display the results in an area below the interface elements
	-allows same page requests without infomration coming to another page
