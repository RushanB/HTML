		<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
		<p>The American Music Awards have been awarded annually since 1973 and determined by a poll 
		of music buyers. The Beatles have received one nomination, plus one special award determined 
		by an Internet poll.<br><br>
		The Brit Awards, originally known as the BPI Awards, were created by the British Phonographic 
		Industry. The Beatles have received three awards. (The initial awards covered the 25-year period 
		from 1952 to 1977. Since 1982, the awards have been an annual event.)<br><br>
		The Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences 
		in the United States. The Beatles have received 8 competitive awards out of 25 nominations. 
		In addition, they received the Lifetime Achievement award in 2014. The Grammy Award for Song 
		of the Year for "Michelle" in 1967 was not awarded to the Beatles as a group, but to John and 
		Paul specifically, as the songwriters.<br>
